## ✨ What Is It?

Every day you unlock your phone dozens of times. Goal on Wall turns that moment into a silent motivator — a beautiful, data-driven wallpaper showing exactly where you are in life, the year, or your journey toward a goal. 

Now featuring a **Dynamic Home Screen** that shows your active goal's progress at a glance, and a **Detailed Analytics Dashboard** to dive deep into your metrics.

---

## 🎨 Wallpaper Types

Choose from **5 powerful calendar types**, each rendered in your preferred visual style:

| Type | Icon | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Life Calendar** | 🟩 | Every week of your life — filled vs remaining |
| **Year Calendar** | 📅 | Days / Months / Quarters of the current year |
| **Goal Calendar** | 🎯 | Countdown from start to your personal deadline |
| **Product Launch** | 🚀 | Days until your big launch day |
| **Fitness Goal** | 💪 | Training days until your event or race |

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Native Resolution Rendering** — Wallpapers are rendered at your device's exact physical pixel dimensions for maximum crispness.
- **One-Tap Sharing** — Share your progress visually (PNG) and textually via WhatsApp, Instagram, or any other app.
- **Customization Redirection** — Tweak your active wallpaper anytime; the app remembers your settings and pre-populates the editor.
- **Goal Analytics** — A dedicated screen with progress charts, total/passed/remaining days, and a visual timeline.
- **History & Memory** — Keeps track of your recently generated wallpapers.
- **Life Calendar** — Visualise your entire life in weeks with an interactive dot grid.
- **Editable Life Expectancy** — Customise the life expectancy used across all life-calendar calculations from Settings.
- **Persistent User Preferences** — Birth date and life expectancy are saved and reused automatically across screens.

## 🖼️ Visual Styles

Each wallpaper type ships with two distinct looks:

| Style | Description |
|---|---|
| **The Flow** | An organic river path that grows as you progress — inspired by nature |
| **Dots** | A crisp grid of dots where filled circles mark time already lived |

---

## 🌈 Themes

The entire app is theme-aware with multiple handcrafted palettes:

- 🌲 **Forest** — Deep greens, moss, and amber (default)
- 🌊 **Ocean** — Deep navy with cyan accents

All colours, gradients, and glass surfaces adapt instantly.
